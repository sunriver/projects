The convention of the versioning
The versions in the main-branch have the schema "1.r.v.m", where the "m" is not equal to 0. If there is interface-changes including new interfaces, we should increment "v" by 1.
The versions in the release-branches have the schema "1.r.v.0", where the "v" must be greater than the greatest "v" in the main branch of "1.r.v.m".
After creating the new release branch, we should increment the the version in the main branch to "1.r+1.0.1".

主分支：                    1.r.0.m，  m > 0, 当有更新时，增加m; 
release分支：       1.r.v.0， 有变化时，增加v。
创建新的branch： 主分支变为“1.(r+1).0.1”， 分支变为1.r.0.0
